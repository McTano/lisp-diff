# Lisp Diff

A tool for highlighting the differences between two symbolic expressions (S-expressions) in Racket (and possibly other languages in the lisp/scheme family). Useful for finding differences buried in complex expressions.

Note that the escape sequences for changing the color of the text in the command line do not work in the REPL built into Dr. Racket. You must run the program in the terminal to see the color-coded output.
